        For first piece designator subject to one of the shift transforms the
        limits are ['8', '1'] and ['h', 'a'].

        The limits are not changed for piece designators which do not limit
        the squares ('q' for example).  Thus 'shift { Q q r }' would leave the
        limits as ['8', '1'] and ['h', 'a'].  The rank range '1-8' and the file
        range 'a-h' do not limit the squares in the relevant direction so these
        two ranges do not adjust the relevant limits.

        A piece designator with a single square sets the low and high limits to
        the square ( 'Kb2' produces ['2', '2'] and ['b', 'b'] for example).

        The four cases with rank and file ranges are:

        'Ra-h1-8' produces limits ['8', '1'] and ['h', 'a'] (not changed)
        'Ra-h2-8' produces limits ['2', '8'] and ['h', 'a']
        'Ra-d1-8' produces limits ['8', '1'] and ['a', 'd']
        'Ra-d2-8' produces limits ['2', '8'] and ['a', 'd']

        A piece designator with a compound square sets the limits to restrict
        shifting:

        'R[b2,g7}' produces ['2', '7'] and ['b', 'g']
        'R[a-h2,g7}' produces ['2', '7'] and ['g', 'g']
        'R[b1-8,g7}' produces ['7', '7'] and ['b', 'g']
        'R[a-h1-8,g7}' produces ['7', '7'] and ['g', 'g']

        Shifts on braced filters are similar:

        'shift { Rb2 kg7 }' produces ['2', '7'] and ['b', 'g']

        and so forth.

        shiftvertical and shifthorizontal generate the same limits but
        application to filters produces different results.
